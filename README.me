# Node.js sentiment

Build a Node.js sentiment analysis program that will use an API with one of these:

-OpenAI GPT-4 (requires signup)
-MonkeyLearn Sentiment Analyzer
-Google Cloud Natural Language AI API (requires signup)
-Text Processing API Sentiment Analysis Demo API

...to analyze text that you pass in on the command line (either as an additional argument or reading from a file) and print out the "mood" of the text, including:

Points:
whether it is positive, negative or neutral
what percentage of each the text is
what kind of confidence rating it has

Stretch goals:

find the endpoint for the Emotion of the text, and print out the various emotions and what levels they are at
